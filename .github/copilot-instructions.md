# Repository Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Project context

- This repository is a template for new development projects. It provides default GitHub workflows, issue/PR templates, rulesets, automation scripts, and documentation. Keep changes aligned with the goal of being reusable and easy to customize for downstream projects.
- The canonical skill documentation lives under `.github/skills/`. Use those files as the source of truth for contribution conventions and review practices.
